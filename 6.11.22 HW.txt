-- create
CREATE TABLE PURCHESES (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, customerId INTEGER, name TEXT NOT NULL, PURCHESES TEXT NOT NULL);

-- insert
INSERT INTO PURCHESES VALUES (1, 123, "daniel", "avocados,bananas");

-- query
SELECT * FROM PURCHESES;


-- What is wrong with the current table definition?
This Database fails the first normal form test
The value in "PURCHESES" is stored as a single string of text, which means it can't be easily queried,
Not to mention the fact that it's name is exactly the same as the Table's name which can lead to confusion.
The primary key in this database is only the id, when it should be the id and the customer id together, since
there can only be one combination of both.

-- What anomalies can occur in a table defines this way?
An accident/error while inserting a new customer could result in two customers having the same "customerId"

-- Refactor the code to normalize the data (First Normal Form)
in file named DatabaseHW6.11.22
Old table named "PURCHESES"
New tables named "Purchases2" and "Items"

-- What law did the table comprimize? 
This is a place i don't know what to put here aaaa
